You can even trap them in areas they cannot escape, such as prison cells.\n For Sneaky Murder, you can drop NPCs into dangerous terrain like Fire, Poison or Lava.

It has a base 2 turn cool down and only costs 3 AP to use, and the slow duration is 2 turns.\nMost AI will try to path find around it making it an obstacle for enemies. Casting Midnight Oil that touches a burning surface will immediately turn it into more burning surface. If cast with a target in its area of effect while they are on a burning surface, it will still slow them before becoming burning surface. If a burning enemy moves into a Midnight Oil, then the oil ignites and becomes a burning surface.\nMidnight Oil can be placed on the ground out of combat in preparation, for a fight. If cast continuously, approximately 5-6 Midnight Oil patches can be placed with enough time to initiate battle. When the first Midnight oil is removed from the field, all connected oil patches are removed, thus timing is needed. In co-op the other player can initiate battle leaving the caster more time to get a sixth or even seventh Midnight Oil in place before a battle.\n When cast on even a little water, the oil disappears in only 1-2 turns.\nIt takes approximately 4 AP to cross a patch of burning surface the size of Midnight Oil.",

As soon as you click the Explode button once, there is no going back. Boom.\n Walking through any environmental damage besides poison easily kills them, causing premature detonation.\n If they get wet or frozen, you will not be able to use their detonation ability, but they will still explode when they die.\n If you summon another creature before the Exploskeleton dies, it will explode before the other summon appears. This means, with enough AP, you can summon the Wind-Up Toy at max range, move at least two meters farther away from it, as it only has a 4 meter casting radius, but a 6 meter radius explosion, then summon another creature anywhere to get an explosion, though avoiding the 6 meter burning ground is advised unless summoning something like a Fire Elemental.\n The above strategy can also be done using an AoE spell after moving away instead of another summon, in order to avoid having to spend action points to attack just to cause an explosion.\n They have 100 Air and Poison resist, so other elements would have to be used for this.\n\n The sooner the Wind-Up Toy explodes, the sooner your enemies die and you win, so although you can wait for its turn for better positioning, there is always a chance their archer will shoot it first and ruin that plan.\n The Wind-Up Toy skill can be used outside of combat and Teleported by an Aerotheurge on top of a group of enemies for a fantastic head start to a fight with no AP spent.
